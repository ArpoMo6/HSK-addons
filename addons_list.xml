ENG
This modification changes the 130mm rockets, the damage has been changed (increased), the textures have been changed, the craft has been changed. The ability to fire rockets at neighboring maps has been added (a 155mm cannon can, but not rockets?). For rockets, different damage has been prescribed for the enemy base.
Fragmentation rockets - the number of fragments has been increased.
Incendiary rockets - received a new filling of white phosphorus, burns long and brightly.
Amy missiles - in addition to the damage from Amy, they received a shock wave of mechanoids (tests are needed to see how convenient it is to fry robots now)
Antimatter missiles - There was a cluster, but there is no cluster of mechanoids (excluded from the siege equipment so that the colony had a chance)
4 types of attack drones
1 new type of mine
1 launcher
The update adds a catapult for UAVs - a more accurate analogue of the Mortar. Please note that UAVs are extremely dangerous. Allows you to fire at neighboring cells.

Eng
Added white phosphorus cartridges for calibration:

  </description><preview_image>About/preview.png</preview_image></repository><repository><repo_id>590500502</repo_id><owner>TheLoneTec</owner><repo_name>Celsius-SK</repo_name><mod_root_path /><name>Celsius</name><description>Celsius adds realistic simulation of thermodynamics to the game.

Main features:

- Temperature is simulated for every map cell (as opposed to vanilla's room-level abstraction). It is hot near fires and geyzers. Various building materials have different isolation properties based on their real-world counterparts. Mountains provide more stable temperature (which you can adjust) as do large bodies of water.

- Water can freeze, and ice can melt. Rivers, seas and marshes may turn into icy plains in the winter and melt again in the summer. Setting up fires on glaciers can uncover water or ground underneath. Be careful, so that your pawns don't drown in deep water. 

- Flammable things may spontaneously ignite when it gets extremely hot. Different materials have different ignition temperatures, and it can affect buildings, manufactured items, plants and more.

- Tweaks to various related features, such as wind and wetness affecting pawns' comfortable temperature and snow melting faster under rain.

Celsius opens up many new challenges and ways to play RimWorld. Forgo houses and warm colonists at campfires, melt ice sheets or unleash deadly firestorms on your enemies!

Supported mods:
- Alpha Animals
- Insulation
- Primitive Workbenches
- Vanilla Furniture Extended: base mod, Architect, Medical, Security
- Windows

All DLCs are supported. Mod authors can provide patches on their side or submit PRs in Github.

FAQ:

- Can I install the mod in an existing save? Can I remove it?

Celsius can be installed in an ongoing game. It may take a few seasons for all the temperatures to adjust.  Note that Celsius deeply changes temperature-related gameplay in RimWorld, so you will almost certainly need to adapt both your base and your play style. Removal mid-game is also theoretically possible but untested. 

- How does it affect performance?

I worked hard to optimize the mod, and it shouldn't seriously slow down your game. In my tests on a rather ordinary laptop I haven't noticed any impact at all. Old machines and multiple or very big maps may have a different experience, but it shouldn't brick your computer.

- Any known incompatibilities?

Heat Map, Proxy Heat and similar mods are not needed, because Celsius does everything these mods do (and much more). Other mods that also change temperature-related mechanics will also probably conflict.

Some modded vents, coolers and the like may experience issues or be unbalanced. There have been reported problems with Vanilla Expanded reactors and Android Tiers cores overheating.

In general, mods that add walls, doors and building stuff may need patches. Celsius will do its best to adapt to them, but can't magically tell what thermal properties these things should have.

- How do I report issues or share feedback?

The best option is to use Github: https://github.com/GarwelGarwel/Celsius/issues

You may also leave comments on the Steam page. If you are reporting a bug, make sure to enable Debug Logging in the settings and attach the Player.log file.

[RUS - переводчик]

		  Теперь поддержка русского перевода благодаря г-ну Винни Пух 

		Si vis pacem, para bellum - Если хочешь мира, готовься к войне
		

+ Новое исследование и небольшой патч совместимости с модами "Vile's Pre-Industrial" и "HSK More Content"

Основной целью этого мода было добавить больше оружия для базового HSK, на данный момент

Мод добавляет оружие, боеприпасы, взрывчатку, турели, а новое обновление добавляет их больше, включая новый баланс, новые исследования, новые патчи для HSK More Content и Vile's Mod (точнее доиндустриальный)

Материал для добавления разнообразия боя и теперь включает в себя хронологическое исследование прогресса.

О любой проблеме сообщите мне или закрепите меня на сервере Discord или в моей ветке мода, я провожу большую часть своего времени на английском сервере, любые предложения, отзывы и отчеты об ошибках всегда приветствуются! (Мне они действительно нужны), спасибо за использование моего мода


Извините, мне трудно переводить журнал изменений, но я постараюсь предоставить его.

Have you ever wondered why is it that we just need stone blocks or steel to build a bed, while wool and fur pile up on the warehouse, unused? Do you get a feeling it would be way more comfortable to lay down on something soft? And what if that cozy bed could also help with the freezing cold? Well, that's what this mod is all about!
Now your beds will only provide full comfort if you add some mattress, pillows and a blanket - or a bedding set, to simplify - which can be made at your regular tailor bench or crafting spot. More than that: depending on what these are made of, your beds can get even more comfortable than the regular ones, affecting their effectiveness in providing rest as well. Also, the material insulation properties carries over to the bed, helping keep your pawns warm.
But blankets, of course, can't help with the heat. For those playing on tropical climates, we included a tropical alternative to beds: hammocks! How come nobody thought of that before? These cheap hanging rigs may not be as comfortable as a full bed, but they do help cooling off. And being cheap and light, they can also be used as travel beds, just like bedrolls!

	    This is a fork and continuation of Open the Windows. The original mod was by jptrrs, patched to 1.3 by MangoThunder, with seamless texture edits by Yap. All three have been rolled together along with a number of optimizations, updates and balances adjustments.
	
		Patched for Hardcore SK by Vile Heathen.	</description><preview_image>Vile Patch - The Windows/About/preview.png</preview_image></repository><repository><repo_id>406405970</repo_id><owner>xenomacabre</owner><repo_name>VilesMods</repo_name><mod_root_path>Vile REQUISITE - SK_Fences and Floors</mod_root_path><name>VileRequisite-Fences And Floors by HSK</name><description>
This mod adds 4 new styles of flooring and 4 fences (3 perimeter fences and a smaller defensive barrier). Fences are gathered into their own menu category and research requirements have been applied where appropriate. Plywood paneling and the simple wood fence are available from the beginning and are relatively simple to construct. Upon completing the Machining research requirement access to chainlink fencing, high security fencing, the security barrier, steel grate flooring, and metal panel flooring is made available. The last addition, sensor panel flooring, becomes constructable upon completing a new research project: "Reactive Flooring."

Some additions exhibit special qualities. Steel grating has an inherent bonus to cleanliness due to most dust and detritus falling cleanly through the grate. Wood and chainlink fences can be fired through while providing a small amount of cover. The security barrier can be walked over (though with some difficulty), much like vanilla sandbags, but still provide good cover from incoming fire. Lastly, sensor panels include advanced electronics, sensors, and networking components within their design. They are expensive and difficult to construct but react to the presence of pedestrians moving overhead by optimizing their surface to the users stride resulting in a more pleasant walk.

Viles notes:
Wood fence overwrites the new vanilla fence. Also changed some values here and there to work with my other mods.</description><preview_image>Vile REQUISITE - SK_Fences and Floors/About/Preview.PNG</preview_image></repository><repository><repo_id>406405970</repo_id><owner>xenomacabre</owner><repo_name>VilesMods</repo_name><mod_root_path>Vile's Amuse Bouche</mod_root_path><name>Vile's Amuse Bouche</name><description>

Thank you everyone for the continued feedback. Special thanks to Sidfu, Pautinich, and Kamil for their patronage :Raises Wineglass of Soup:
  
Dozens of new meals to make. 

Late-game high-cuisine recipes. 

Completely re-engineered meal hediff system. 

13 categories of foods grouped by hediffs. 

New hot pepper crops, resources.

New deep-fryer building.

Patching/adjusting biome base weathers to compensate, but likely will need some balance adjustment as we test it. Savanna will alternate a lot between month-long monsoon rains and droughts. Added harvestable caribou moss and bearberries from the Tundra to make it more playable. Adjusted grow-rate of grasses for cold biomes and moved some around a bit. More balance tweaks here and there and more to come.

Version 0.12A - 1/19/2022 - Remixed boreal a bit, added back in missing water terraforms, fixed yet another framerate issue (should be final this time). Keep the feedback comin'!
Version 0.11A - 1/18/2022 - fixed issue affecting framerate during cold weather, missing textures, improves some textures.
Version 0.1A - 1/17/2022
	
Dislaimer: This is a brand new mod, which means it needs some testing. By reading this, you agree to offer your soil in exchange for early access to this mod. That is to say, please send me feedback on discord if anything seems weird or buggy, or if something just looks off. And before you ask, yes, you'll have to start a new game, or at least move your colony to a new tile so the biome can regenerate. I also recommend using the patched Seasonal Weather mod with this.

Thank you everyone for the continued feedback. Special thanks to Sidfu, Pautinich, and Kamil for their patronage :Raises Wineglass of Bog Water:

Biomes: From The Groud Up overhauls biomes... from the ground up. Here's the dirt:
	
1. Retextures nearly every plant and tree and adds many new ones. Some are harvestable, some are purely aesthetic.
2. Repopulates biomes to be more realistic, but more importantly, more distinct from one another.	
3. Retextures (moved from Hardcore Renovation) and revises terrains, and adds several new ones to further give the biomes more distinction.
4. Terrain generation is revised to form more unique landmasses in some biomes.
5. Trees more likely to grow in groves (moved from Wood You Please).
6. Terraforming revised to be (hopefully) more streamlined - it's a balancing work in progress.
7. Scatterables removed from ice and sand (those ugly blotches that are always there)
8. Adds a few new foods to go with the new plants (bog cranberries, wetland cattails, desert prickly pears, and brought back blueberries which grow in taiga and boreal)
9. Biomes have seasonal weather (requires supporting mod), some have wet and dry seasons, wildfire seaons, hurricane seasons, etc. 	
	
Now for what's new and different:

___SOILS!___
New and revised soils are based off of US Soil Taxonomy (which isn't really important unless you're a nerd). They're listed in order of fertility:

Rich Soil - Alluvium - typically only found around ponds and in small patches.
Grassland Soil - Mollisol - Found in the savanna.
Fertile Soil - Alfisol - Found in termperate forests, equivalent of vanilla "soil"
Volcanic Soil - Andisol - Currently only found in small patches in rainforests, but can be terraformed with ash.
Red Clay Soil - Ultisol - Found in rainforests. It turns out rainforests don't have great soil.
Marshy Soil - Mineral Hydric Soil - Found in wetlands
Leached Soil - Oxisol - Found in rainforests.
Mossy Soil - Spododsol - Found is boreal forests and tundra in smaller amounts.
Arid Soil - Aridisol - Found in deserts.
Muck - Sapric Histosol - Found in Tropical Swamps. Contains moderate amounds of peat and organic matter.
Cracked Clay - Vertisol - Found in deserts. Nutrients and be extracted via terraforming.
Weak Soil - Inseptisol - Young soils found in boreal forests.
Mucky Peat - Hemist Histosol - Found in temperate swamps. Contains a fair amount of peat and some organic matter.
Turbulent Soil - Gelisol (Turbels) - Rocky tundra soil. 
Peat Soil - Fabrist Histosol - Found in Bogs. Contains high amounts of peat.
Undeveloped Soil - Entisol - Found near rock forms and gravel.
Coarse Sand - Found in beaches and deserts with barely any nutrient value.
Desert Sand - Dune sand found in extreme deserts. Nothing can grow here and it's hard to walk on.
Gravel - Relatively unchanged apart from new texture.
Desert Pavement - A strange formation sometimes found in deserts.
Bog Water - Highly acidic water found in bogs.
Swamp Water - Found in temperate swamps.
Black Water - Found in tropical swamps.
Ice - Good ol' ice. 
Clear Ice - Smooth ice which is very hard to traverse.
Frozen Snow - Easier to walk on than ice.

___NEW PLANTS!___
There are lots of new plants. Here are a few:

TREES and SHRUBS:
Kapok Tree: Gigantic trees found in the rainforest (experimental two-layer texture).
Spruce Tree: Found in bogs and cold regions.
Acacia Tree: Found in savannas and deserts.
Juniper: Coniferous shrub found in colder regions.

EDIBLE:
Blueberry.
Cranberries: Only found in bogs.
Prickly pear: Found in savannas and deserts.
Cattail: Found in wetlands.

GRASSES and MOSSES:
Sedge
Rush
Swampgrass (grows in water)
Lawn Grass
Peat Moss: Can be harvested for fertilizer
Bearberry: Decorative tundra groundcover
Caribou Moss

___NOTES___

Cattail and swampgrass currently have this thing where they appear in places they should when you first generate the map, but will disappear immediately. It shouldn't affect gameplay.

Some pretty drastic changes were made to some of the biome generation. It's impossible for me to test every possible iteration, so please send feedback if you find anything weird.

=====================================
VILE'S HELL BENT FOR LEATHER Tanning 
V.0.3
AUG.16.2022
=====================================

Hell Bent for Leather Tanning is another supplement to Vile's overhaul system which adds, uhhhh, leather tanning. 

This is currently in early alpha, and I have very limited time for testing so I'm humbly relying on help for feedback and bug reports. So, um, take that as both a disclaimer and a plead. I will try to make updates daily. Thanks in advance!

Some feedback I would appreciate:
	- Missing/wrong textures (note that the leather colors will likelye change)
	- Missing or broken recipes
	- Balance issues with recipes and materials
	- Elements that just don't seem "fun"
	- Content you want to see
	- Any other bugs or things that don't seem right
	
Notes for fellow modders and patchers at the end of this doc!

=====================================
QUICK GUIDE / WHAT'S NEW
=====================================

Hides and Skins: When you butcher an animal, you now get hides, skins and furs instead of leather. This makes the production chain more challenging, but it also gives you options and new materials and colors to play with. 

Once you get going, you'll have a choice once you're ready to tan your hides. You can produce full-grain leathers, which uses the entire thickness, showing the true grain of the skin. It's the superior option. Because blemishes of the hide's surface must be cut off, there is wasted product in the form of strips, which can later be made into poor-quality bonded leather. Your other option is to split the hide. This will give you an unfinished "top-grain" leather where the blemishes are sanded off so you get more leather for your dollar. That's not all - you also get the split leather, or the flesh-side of the leather. This is suede. It kinda sucks but it breathes nicely and can made into "genuine leather". The top-grains leathers can also be dyed and processed into embossed finished leather, nubuck, and upholstry leather. There are also ways to produce ultra-grade leathers using products harvested from Feenix, Kirins, Thrumbos and similar animals.

ROTTING AND CURING: Raw skins and hides will eventually rot unless you cure them or freeze them. There are two ways to cure hides:

- Drying Rack: Small skins can be air dried, but thicker hides must be cured with salt or ash. Takes over a day.

- Brining Station: Soak skins and	 hides in brine. Uses salt as fuel, and can be done quiclkly be a colonist.

- Freezing: Just throw it in a freezer.

LEATHER TANNING: Hides and skins must be tanned to become useable leather.

- Brain Tanning: A traditional method using animal innards and smoking at a campfire. Produces only buckskin. Neolithic Tech.

- Vegetable Tanning: A method that uses tannins from tree bark to tan the hide. Can take over a day.

- tree bark is now produced when cutting wood.

- Chrome Tanning: A method of tanning that uses chromium. Fast and done in large batches, but long exposure to the tanning drum can cause serious heath effects.

=====================================
LLEATHER GRADES (and their bet uses)
=====================================
FULL-GRAIN LEATHER - Premium leather. Uses the whole hide, with wasted strips leftover.
	Breathable Leather 
	Exotic Leather
	Heavy Leather 
	Durable Leather	
	Stock Leather	
	Light Leather
	Soft Leather
	Sterile Leather
	Warm Fur
	Rugged Fur
	Heavy Fur
	Fine Fur
	
TOP-GRAIN LEATHERS - Instead of using the full grain, the leather can be split. The top part can be processed later into more useful leathers and dyed various colors.
	Unfinished Leather	
	Finished Leather
	Nubuck
	Upholstry Leather
	
SPLIT LEATHERS et al - The flesh side of the split. Not as good quality as the top grain.
	Suede 
	Genuine Leather
	Bonded Leather(made from leftover leather strips)
	
ULTRA-GRADE LEATHER - Large beasts like Feenix and Thrumbo drop resources when butchered that can be mixed with leathers to produce superior leathers.
	Ventan Leather (compare to Feenix Leather)
	Thermatan Leather (compare to Kirin leather)
	Armatan Leather (best for armor)
	Hygieiatan Leather (best for hospitals)
	
Hard Leather Materials: New and revised materials that can be used in place of metal in certain armor recipes and clothing.
	Rawhide
	Cuir Bouilli (aka boiled leather)
	Chitin
	Dragon Scales (from wyvern, kirin, feenix)

=====================================
MODDING / PATCHING NOTES:
=====================================
Hide defs are new, most leather defs are patched from existing defs. So if you add another mod which adds new pawns, you will need to change the "leatherType" to one of the new hide defs. Furthermore, you'll want to reduce the "leatherAmount" by 1/5th since tanning multiplies the ingredients by 5-ish.

This is the final major part of the Vile's series of overhaul mods for Hardcore SK. It finishes what Metallurgy and Pre-Industrial Overhaul started, namely, adding realism, complixity, and streamlines and rebalances materials while making it a bit more intuitive. Unlike Metallurgy though, it doesn't add a lot more steps in the production chain. Here's a rundown of the overhaul:
        
    CHANGES and ADDITIONS:
    - New Ore Refining system. "Iron Ore", "Tin Ore" replaced with "Magnetite" and "Cassiterite" etc. These are refined to their base elements at the Metal Extraction Plant. Inspired by Angel's Factorio mod.
        - With improved techology and the Electrolytic Refinery, more and new base metals can be extracted from the ores at the expense of work speed and electrical power.
    - Labels and descriptions are improved to make finding materials and knowing which ones to use easier.
    - Most materials revised, with many added ones, including alloys, plastics, textiles, etc.
    - A revised materials tier system: Tiers are divided by tech level, but each material within each tier does something it excels at over the others. Suggested uses are easily laid out in the descriptions.
    - Revised recipes for items and buildings, to utilize the new materials and add realism.
    - Rimefeller overhaul, with an expanded polymer industry. 
        - Petrochemical byproducts include ethylene, benzene, petroleum coke, etc. 
        - Instead of only "plastic" you have PVC, polycarbonate, fiberglass, aerographene, and more.
    - A few intermediate materials are replaced with things that make more sense. No more "compound paste" and "paraffins". Now we have "epoxy resin" and "teflon".
    - Added a new "chemistry station" for new chemicals such as lye, chlorine, etc.
    - Plant wax replaces paraffins as a fuel for candles.
    - Coin minting added. Refining galena ore gives you "pure silver".
    - IMPORTANT! The electrylytic refinery must be linked (near) to the metal extraction plant to refine ores, and the chemistry station must be linked to the loom to make advanced textiles. Note that these recipes don't appear in the wikirim. Looking into it.
    - And of course, tons of new and revised textures.

    ROADMAP:
    - Cool spreasheets and stuff because those are fun.
    - Nucleosynthesis Converter recipes.
    - Make stuff masks for some MS building textures.
    - Add 2 new concrete types.
    - Update mineral/rock textures.
    - Insulation Support for Celcius mod.
    - New refinery building textures.
    - Integrate new glass types with Windows.
    - Revamp late-game power generation. Perhaps add geothermal drilling.
    - Rimatomics defense materials.
    - Various buildings and recipes as I come across them, or are brought to my attention.
    - HSK currently doens't work well with the “heat” damage type. This will improve as we go into 1.4.
    
    Many of my other mods are updated to work with this, so make sure to get the latest of those.

Update A0.3
-Updated for 1.3
-Lead smelting now produces 15 instead of 10. Quick fix until the upcoming Ores and Minerals update. For now, set up a mining camp if your map lacks lead.
-Added mod dependencies. Consider using Realistic Terraforming to get peat, clay, etc quicker. I've not tested this without it.
-Making Rimatomics a dependancy. There's an assembly in there that allows the water wheel to use any large water body, not just rivers.
-Fixed some typos etc.
	
INTRODUCTION	
This could also be called 'Pre-Industrial Part II: Metallurgical Overhaul'. It's part of an ongoing project of mine to add some more complex mechanics to HSK that are both realistic and historically accurate, but in a manner that makes it fun, immersive, and hopefully intuitive.

That said, this is the first part of a materials overhaul, with focus on early-game metallurgy and steel-making. Below is a quick summary of how it works. There is more detailed information in the descriptions of the buildings and resources, and a wiki/guide is underway.
	
NEOLITHIC
A new fire pit is added which separates non-food recipes from the campfire, and adds a few more, mainly for dealing with smelting metals of antiquity such as bronze and silver.
	
CERAMIC KILN
The kiln now acts like the fermenter buildings in that you load it with stuff, and then wait several days or hours instead of standing there watching it. It's in the "processing" submenu and you'll make things such as:
		Bricks
		Charcoal
		Coke (metallurgical coal that is further processed)
		Flux powder (used in ceramics and metallurgy)
		Wootz Steel
		Clay pots
	
WOOTZ STEEL
Commonly referred to as "Damascus Steel" because a lot of wootz steel was imported to Damascus, it's a fragile, but ultra-hard steel best used for cutlery and sharp weapons.

POTTERY STATION
There is a new pottery station for making clay pots for food storage. They can be glazed with a variety of materals to increase beauty and make it seal better for improved food preservation. Vanilla pots can still be made out of metal, but they're more expensive and inferior to glazed pottery. Clay pots must be fired in the kiln, and then used as an ingredient much like how a crate is used to make a turret.

BLOOMERY and WROUGHT IRON / FORGED STEEL
The earlist technology for smelting iron. Ore is smelted into an "iron bloom", which then must be hammered into wrought iron at smithy forge (or finery forge). It's a long process with low payout, but you'll eventually run out of tin or copper for producing bronze so you'll want to start making wrought iron. Like you learned in history class. The wrought iron can further be carburized into weld-forged steel, your first type of proper steel. Contrary to popular belief, however, wrought iron can still be used to make effective weapons and armor — in this mod it is considered that these wrought iron implements are "case hardened", or tempered to strengthen the outer surface of the iron into a thin layer of steel.

BOG IRON from PEAT
Small pellets of iron can often be found in peat bogs. You can extract bog iron from peat at machining tables for a never-ending supply of iron. Mining is still the most efficient way to getting it though.

BLAST FURNACE AND PIG IRON
The blast furnace replaces the vanilla furnace. It makes iron ore into pig iron instead (a crude high-carbon form of iron which is worthless on its own). The pig must be processed at a finery into wrought iron and is much faster and more efficient than processing bloom. Pig iron can also be refined into cast iron at a foundry.

FINERY FORGE / WATER WHEEL
The finery forge is like a smithy forge except it has a heavy mechanical trip-hammer required for smashing the carbon out of pig iron to turn it into wrought iron (or welded steel). It can be operated by hand, but it's best powered by a water wheel. It's smart to build by a FLOWING RIVER if you can, otherwise you may want to rush the foundry and puddling tech.

STAMP MILL / WATER WHEEL
Another way to take advantage of the water wheel is with the stamp mill. It can be used for smashing grain, but also making gunpowder and crushing stone into rubble or sand.

FOUNDRY, CASTING
The foundry is dual purpose: It can be used for casting, which is a method of producing items quickly and in large batches. It's limited to certain types of tools, components and ammunition, and the castable metals are also very limited. It can also be used for processing certain metals and alloys, notably cast iron, and turning pig iron into wrought iron through what is called "puddling" - a method which is much more efficient than through the finery. It can also be used to produce crucible steel. More on that next.

CEMENTATION FURNACE and BLISTER STEEL / CRUCIBLE STEEL
This building works much like the kiln. Fill it with wrought iron and a source of carbon and wait several days. The iron becomes what's known as "blister steel", which is not homogenous and is useless on its own. It can be processed at a smithy or finery to produce "sheer steel", which resembles forge-welded steel, and for purposes of simplification, we'll just call it that. The ultimate, purest form of steel produced before the second industrial revolution, however is *Crucible Steel*. This is made by simply melting down the blister steel at the foundry once the tech is unlocked. It requires both coke and flux. 

STEAM ENGINE
The blowing engine is an automated bellows which speeds up the blast furnace and foundry operation.

PIPES
Water pipes are now divided into two types: aqueducts and, well, pipes. The former are made like how you're used to making them, and the latter require "plumbing components", which can be made at a forge or cast at the foundry. They're much stronger and easier to install.

WEAPONS AND TOOLS
A new CHEF KNIFE is added. Unlike the dagger and regular knife, the material used to make them can imply further bonuses. The *ULFBERT* and RIMASCUS SCIMITAR are two new swords that require wootz steel to make. An armor-piercing LUCERNE HAMMER replaces the royalty warhammer, and the royalty axe is removed and replaced with a QUARTERSTAFF, which is good for takedowns and less-lethal stick fighting.
		
Previous Updates: 

A0.2
-Removed grain recipes from stamp mill, fixed it so it's craft-worker based.
-Patched cleaver, dagger, and knife to work as survival tools. The latter is renamed "survival knife" and may instill bonuses to construction and smithing. There's no penalty for not using a knife for cooking, and if the bonusus will only take affect if over 100%. Late-game alloys have cooking bonuses of 100%... updating that is on the road map.
-Fixed some textures
-Improved labels for processing recipes

Adds three biomes: 
Prairie (a temperate grassland)
Montane Forest (a boreal forest variation, less dense, may contain lakes)
Montane Birch Grasslands (a cold grassland)
Adds back Cloudberries, and a new flower, bluebells.


Uses Odeum's Biomes Kit (details below) 

BiomesKit is a framework for the placement of biomes on the world map at worldgen. Previously, modders needed to utilize C# to add new biomes to rimworld. With BiomesKit, placement of a biome can be controlled with XML tags in the BiomeDef itself.

With BiomesKit as a dependency, you too can make your own biomes mod with minimal hassle! Features of BiomesKit includes but are not limited to:
* Spawning biomes based on factors like elevation, rainfall, hilliness and more!
* Restricting your biome to spawn only on specific vanilla biomes, or even biomes from other mods!
* Changing the hilliness of a tile to a specific level, or even randomizing it!
* Custom world map tile graphics for your biome!

This is where I keep minor tweaks for my own personal use. I'll try to keep the file names descriptive so you can delete files and tailor it to your liking.

Changes:
1. Variations of badge textures, added some new ones to cover more skills and military roles.
2. Increased asexual/bisexual/gay commonalities make it more realistic.
3. Inreases likelyhood of a cold snap in winter.

Update 1.2 - 1/20/2020 - Added acacia wood.  
Update 1.1: No major changes, but the new mod Biomes: From The Ground Up, is meant to pair well with this mod.	  
	  
HEY! You want some planks? Planks come from trees. There's lots of different kinds of trees. Planks can be made into all sorts of cool things. Can you? Didn't think so. This is hardcore SK. It's hardcore, like the heartwood of a tree. Show these trees the respect they deserve. Now stop complaining and drink your maple syrup.

Version A0.1  
This is super flipping early alpha. It's a huge overhaul of logs and planks, so I'm not entirely sure how it will affect all other parts of the game or other mods yet. If anything seems weird, recipes broken, etc, please let me know on the HSK Discord.

What does this mod change?
Logs and planks are unique to their tree species and have color and specs rebalanced for realism and a more distinctive gameplay based on biome. 
I highly recommend using this with the my new Hardcore Renovations mod which fully takes advantage of these new wood types in floors and walls.

Basic info:  

Felled trees now produce larger, but fewer logs (with Bamboo as the exception. It's not a tree anyway.), and can't be used as fuel except in advanced furnaces (TBD). A new woodsplitting spot (much like the butcher spot) allows colonists to split the logs into firewood which can be used for crafting redimentary things like arrows, clapboard floors and walls, as fuel, or can be further split into kindling for fueling torches, etc.

I. Wood is now divided into three categories (in order of the janka scale of hardness):

Softwoods:
	  Cecropia
	  Pine
	  Willow
	  Redwood
	  Cypress
	  Poplar
Hardwoods:
	  Maple
	  Teak
	  Birch
	  Oak
      Acacia
	  Bamboo
Ultra-hard:
	  Drago
	  Mangrove

Softer woods tend to offer less HP, but are often easier to work with and the trees are easier to cut. Technically, some of the softwoods are actually hardwoods, but I'm basing this off their actual hardness, not official designations.
Harder woods also produce more firewood since they can be chopped into smaller pieces.  
	  
II. Tree generation has changed.
	  1. Growing time and harvest amount has been adjusted for realism and balance. 
	  2. Most trees are now more likely to grow in groves. This means if you want to harvest a particular type of wood, you can target specific parts of the map to do so. Use the magnifying glass feature on the minimap or the Object Seeker to help find the groves.	  

III. New Woodsplitting Spot is an ingredientless building for splitting logs into firewood and kindling early game. Obviously slower than the workbench.

IV. Anywhere there was a vanilla wood log, there is now "firewood". Anywhere there was vanilla wood planks, there is now plywood. Plywood can be made out of scraps of logs or planks, much how patch leather is made. 
	  
Feedback is appreciated. Thanks!

Update Sept 26, 2021 - Lowered splitting spot workspeed, but also lowered recipe work. Also, you can now build the woodcutting table out of planks if you wish, for increased workspeed.

=====================================
VILE'S Work Tab for Big Fonts        
=====================================
This mod is a minor accessibility mod meant to make the microscopic work tab information easier to see. It is meant to work with the new Vile RimThemes.

- Changes the labels of jobs in the work tab, so instead of Craft: "Do Bills at Neolithic Craft" (which appears as "Do Bills at Ne..." in larger fonts), it's shortened to just "Neolithic".
- Work Types are now ALL CAPS so that they stand apart more from the work defs when you open the worktype to see the subjobs. 
- Some things are moved around. If you don't want that, delete the "reorganized" folder in Patches, and "WorkTypes.xml" in Defs. 

New WorkTypes:
MISC - This is mostly unusued junk. Stuff that may be required by other mods to exist, but typically aren't used in modded HSK.
PROCESSING - This is for mosly hauling jobs that are a bit more on the crafting side. Universal Fermenter jobs are moved here, which includes things like the drying rack, tanning vats, kiln, and cementation furnace.
BIOTECH HAULING - Simply moves some stuff out of hauling into a new work type.

Some other notable changes:
- Refill Water and Refuel Refuelable Buildings (now called "Refuel") are moved to the BASIC worktype.
- Neolithic Crafting is moved to the SMITHING worktype

This is a simple mod that adds new versions of existing apparel, currently just medieval. The stats are identical, but the names are slightly different, such as "bonnet" and "bonnet, brimmed", and the textures are alterled slightly for flavor.

"Why?" you ask. 

Simple. When I play I like to make color-coordinated loadouts. But there aren't enough apparel pieces to make that feasible, at least early game. So this way, I can dress my builders in orange leather tunics, and my farmers in green hemp tunics.

That's all.</description><preview_image>N/A</preview_image></repository><repository><repo_id>314622204</repo_id><owner>ArpoMo6</owner><repo_name>HMC-project</repo_name><mod_root_path>HMC bizarre materials</mod_root_path><name>HMC bizarre materials</name><description>Version 0.20.

Adds 100+ new, vanilla-friendly creatures to the diverse biomes of your Rimworlds. The philosophy of this mod is that every new creatures tries to bring some new mechanic into the game, whether it be walking tanks, living resource farm, indestructible plant monsters, night time stalkers, or plain speedy giant spiders. Some of the mechanics are simple, others much more complex.

These animals will spawn in certain biomes, some others will only be available via traders. You'll have to explore to find them all! The Alpha Biomes is a companion mod that adds several new alien biomes to house these weird creatures.

Bear in mind that spawn probabilities have been calculated with no other animal mods installed. If you have, for example, Vanilla Animals Expanded, less animals from this mod will appear, obviously.

The mod will also add new insects in a new faction, the Black Hive. Raids from that faction can be disabled via Mod Options.

&lt;size=24&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;

There shouldn't be any. Balance is obviously always a concern, although it has been playtested. Feel free to tell me if you think something is too wacky.

&lt;size=24&gt;Plans for the future&lt;/size&gt;
Obviously, more animals!

&lt;size=24&gt;Compatibility&lt;/size&gt;
Compatible with A Dog Said... 
Compatible with the implants from Vanilla Genetics Expanded
Compatible with Alpha Biomes (duh)
Compatible with Advanced Biomes
Compatible with Rainbeau Realistic Planets
Compatible with Lords of the Rims - Elves (mallorn biome)

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;

Adds 12 new diverse biomes to your Rimworlds. The mod has been designed with the Alpha Animals mod in mind, although it is not a requirement.

- The Mycotic Jungle: a warm and humid biome filled with HUGE mushrooms. Home to the Wildpod and some weird mushroom varieties of usual creatures.
- The Gallatross Graveyard: an arid temperate biome, littered with the skeletal remains of ancient beasts.
- The Feralisk Infested Jungle: a warm, wet biome with incredibly dense vegetation, filled to the brink with extremely dangerous predatory spiders.
- The Ocular Forest: a weird transdimensional realm intruding upon our Universe. Home to strange new flora and fauna.
- The Gelatinous Superorganism: a swampy biome that is actually the upper surface of an extraordinarily large mold-like creature. No rocks to be found, but plenty of food.
- The Mechanoid Intrusion: a desolate temperate biome with mechanical ruins. Apparently an ancient mechanoid attempt at turning the planet into a megastructure.
- The Propane Lakes: a frozen wasteland, colder than the most inhospitable Sea Ice, but teaming with aberrant flora and fauna.
- The Forsaken Crags: permanently clouded by a preternatural darkness, light is the most valuable commodity in this desertic landscape. Inspired by (and compatible with) the Forsakens mod.
- The Tar Pits: an arid biome rich in vegetation, filled with treacherous tar pits that make movement quite difficult. Beware the Bumbledrone hives! 
- The Pyroclastic Conflagration: a volcanic expanse of unrelenting and brutal nature. Fire and lava are both your worst enemy and your best friend in this biome.
- The Idyllic Meadows: a lush meadow of giant flowers. A super easy biome that provides tons of resources and few predators.
- The Miasmic Mangrove: a dangerous tropical biome full of debilitating diseases.


The biomes have been tweaked so they don't take too much space in the world map, and you might have to generate a planet again if some biome is not appearing, since they have different temperature and humidity characteristics.

&lt;size=24&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;

Balance is obviously always a concern, although it has been playtested. Feel free to tell me if you think something is too wacky.

&lt;size=24&gt;Plans for the future&lt;/size&gt;

Maybe more biomes, who knows!

&lt;size=24&gt;Compatibility&lt;/size&gt;

Compatible with any other biome mod 
Compatible with Alpha Animals (obviously)
Compatible with Magical Menagerie
Compatible with Dinosauria
Compatible with Megafauna
Compatible with Animal Collab Project
Compatible with Vanilla Animals Expanded
Compatible with Rim of Madness - Bones
Compatible with Vanilla Fishing Expanded (adds 19 new fish)
Compatible with Fish Industry
Compatible with Forsakens
Compatible with Camouflage and Stealth
Compatible with Fertile Fields

Mods that modify the way the world is generated MAY cause some weird results. Use at your own risk.

&lt;size=20&gt;Description&lt;/size&gt;
What if we were to finally discover dinosaur DNA sequences, despite being incomplete, and fill the blanks with various genome sequences spliced from left and right, with a little bit of imagination to help guide us?

Wonder no more! A group of Glitterworld scientists, having long abandoned the ideals to terraform the rimworlds with a purpose, went out of their ways to answer just that. With the mechanoids long having gone haywire with their terraforming projects, the dinosaurs created in labs were slowly introduced into fauna that should otherwise have resembled a 21st Century Earth, with little to no care as to their compatibility with existing wildlife and the forsaken rimworld colonists, the latter of which nobody seems to care about anyway.

&lt;size=20&gt;Dinosaurs&lt;/size&gt;
32 new species of dinosaurs are introduced through this mod, all of which spawn in various different biomes:
- Ankylosaurus,
- Brachiosaurus,
- Brontosaurus,
- Utahraptor,
- Gallimimus,
- Iguanodon,
- Pachycephalosaurus,
- Parasaur,
- Spinosaurus,
- Stegosaurus,
- Triceratops,
- Tyrannosaurus Rex,
- Velociraptor,
- Carnotaurus,
- Protoceratops,
- Yutyrannus,
- Corythosaurus,
- Diplodocus,
- Dryosaurus,
- Baryonyx,
- Dilophosaurus,
- Compsognathus,
- Therizinosaurus,
- Minmi,
- Gigantoraptor,
- Dakotaraptor,
- Deinocheirus,
- Pteranodon,
- Stygimoloch,
- Quetzalcoatlus,
- Magyarosaurus,
- Allosaurus.

This mod provides an additional way to fortify your Frontline with new bunker structures:

[u]General[/u]:

- You need to do research in order to get these structures.
- The bunkerroof is not a real roof as of terms of game mechanics, you still will have to build a room like in vanilla 

[u]Structures[/u]:

[i]Bunker wall:[/i]
Slope walls are the foundation of your bunker. Needs A LOT of resources to build but can withstand even the hardest bombardement. Bombs harm it more than ordinary bullets. Takes a lot of time to be set up.

[i]Bunker embrasure:[/i]
Waist high walls grant your pawns a spot to use their own arms in combat and also provides some cover (70%) . Also in contrast to the ordinary sanbags, enemys can't climp over these structures. Bombs harm it more than ordinary bullets. Takes a lot of time to be set up.

[i]Bunker door:[/i]
A heavy door granting passage inside the bunker. It can only be opened manually. Holds of fire for a long time, but costs a lot of resources. Bombs harm it more than ordinary bullets. Takes a lot of time to be set up.

[i]Bunkerroof:[/i]
A semi transparent roofing. Comes in the sizes 5x5 and 3x3. [i][notification: More sizes MIGHT come on demand, maybe start a discussion here.][/i]  Does not hold a roof by itself, it needs surroundings. Takes a lot of time to be set up.


Feel free to leave a comment and please report back any occuring bugs. And finally: Have Fun.

---

&lt;size=20&gt;Description&lt;/size&gt;
Thanks to the wonders of today's technology, the small group of scientists that was previously known for bringing the Megatherium-
Uh, I mean, the Megasloth back to life, was able to make the Megafauna Project a reality! 
This time around, they were able to recreate 38 different species of animals that used to inhabit planet Earth thousands to millions years ago. 
...Was that a wise move? Who cares! Now we all can feast our eyes on those glorious beasts as they will slowly inevitably turn all the ecosystems we know upside-down!

&lt;size=20&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
38 new species of animals, all able to spawn naturally in different biomes:
- Arthropleura,
- Doedicurus,
- Daeodon,
- Gigantopithecus,
- Paraceratherium,
- Titanis,
- Titanoboa,
- Woolly Mammoth,
- Elasmotherium,
- Smilodon,
- Chalicotherium,
- Megaloceros,
- Procoptodon,
- Megalania,
- Gomphotaria,
- Diprotodon,
- Short-faced Bear,
- Dinocrocuta,
- Sivatherium,
- Andrewsarchus,
- Dinornis,
- Macrauchenia,
- Quinkana,
- Deinotherium,
- Aurochs,
- Megalochelys,
- Palaeeudyptes,
- Josephoartigasia,
- Gigantophis,
- Meganeura,
- Zygolophodon,
- Platybelodon,
- Purussaurus,
- Uintatherium,
- Pulmonoscorpius,
- Dinopithecus,
- Castoroides,
- Enhydriodon.

These animals are quite rare, and should be a good challenge to either tame or slay. 
A lot of them can also be used as pack animals for a caravan (with paraceratherium being your new best caravan buddy!).
Wooly mammoth, elasmotherium, and josephoartigasia are shearable, and arthropleura, titanis, titanoboa, megalania, dinornis, quinkana, megalochelys, palaeeudyptes, gigantophis, meganeura, and purussaurus do lay eggs. Sivatherium, macrauchenia, aurochs cows, and uintatherium are milkable - sivatherium's milk is very nutritious and quite valuable!

Megafauna will automatically detect and patch both A Dog Said... by SpoonShortage and Giddy-up! by Roolo, so make sure to make it load after those mods.

&lt;size=20&gt;Languages&lt;/size&gt;
English, Polish,

&lt;size=20&gt;Credits&lt;/size&gt;
Roolo - for great help with making Megafauna compatible with his Giddy-up mod.
Nightinggale - for his immensely useful ModCheck.

&lt;size=20&gt;Changelog&lt;/size&gt;

			- some of the animals can now spawn in the new swamp-type biomes (titanoboa's no longer exclusive to the tropical rainforest!),
			- some of the older animals such as arthropleura and doedicurus now have their own body types instead of using unfitting vanilla ones,

    Rabbie The MoonRabbit Race

    As you can see in the night sky, the moon exists in the Rimworld. And there are residents in the moon.
    Rabbbies are races that migrate from moon to moon beyond the universe.
    With a brilliant brain and close to Glitterworlds technology, they are prospering all universe by building a giant arcology, the moon city.

     +Rabbie is smart and smart, and stands out in intellectual activities like research + 
     -But they're mentally unstable, so they have higher mentalbreak threshhold - 
     -and are more severely affected by Psychic waves - 
     +Due to the long history of war, combat skills have been developed, allowing fast shooting and more accuracy + 
     +They have also developed the ability to safely treat and operate on injured people and to synth drugs + 
     -However, because of their weak body structure, they are very vulnerable to melee combat. - 
     -they have lower carrying capacity and the lower speed of mining - 

      Planetarium  

    Long ago, the ancestors of Rabbie who were migrating were captured by Transcendent Planet and genetically manipulated throughout the Spaceship, they got excellent intellectual abilities, but in the absence of a special substance called Planetarium, they became lunatic.

    The only places where Rabbitish empires can migrate are rare planets that can harvest planetarium. It is mostly because of the Planetarium that the soldiers of the empire and the Dept.Energysupply staffs come down to the planet and cause friction with Planet's natives or civilizations.
    Rabbies are also enjoying this material, commonly called  'Spice' . A refined Planetarium can also be consumed, but it will give you a richer scent when you drink it with tea or cocktails and keep your more mental clearer.
    Rabbie, who has consumed planetarium for a long time, is said to have the ability to see a blurry but short future and have an amazing shooting ability.

    You can also replenish Planetarium, at least in part, by ingesting Braincrystal-the nervous system in which planetarium is crystallized-which can be found when you open the head of a deceased Rabbie. It's a scary story.
    Wherever Rabbies are, saving planetarium will be a top priority. Otherwise, you may have a terrible ending.

      New faction, Rabbitish Empire  
    The Rabbitish empire migrates to the moons of several planets for a long time to build a city, but because of its long distance, it cuts off from the empires of the previous universe and elects a new empress of the universe.
    The Rabbitish empire's policy on the planet depends on Empress's thinking and the development of the moon city.
    Rabbitish Soldiers and scientists on the planet are in duty of the enormous energy and planetarium needs of the moon city and its citizens.
    They may be exclusive or hostile at first, but they will usually be indifferent if they feel not threatening to their work or if you are cooperative.

    Make hostile impressions on them, or do not let your forces feel threats to them.
    If your settlement is both, be careful! The Rabbitish Empire is a country with a lot of war experience. They have been at war with the inhabitants of various planets, and victory against many of civilizations. If they think you threaten the empire, you'll be attacked with advanced technology.
    do not recommend shooting against them like line-infantry. because it's the beneficial combat of the Rabbitish Empire. They will be relatively weak before melee.
    Their army consists of a field army of Rabbie citizens and a regular army descending in space with power armor.

      Two Storytellers  
    Cele Jackrabbit - Cele Jackrabbit is a senior officer in the Rabbitish Empire. Drink spice tea together in her flagship, and carefully listen to the War of the Rabbitish Empire and the history of blood (most events are replaced by raids, increasing in difficulty and preparing for war. )

    Luna Jackrabbit - (Coming soon) Cele's sister, Luna, is Scientist of Dept.energysupply. She is working to cure the mental problems that Rabbie race has brought down from now on. she say quiet and clearly, but you will be listens to increasingly confusing and scary stories.

      etc  
     Various Pawn Customizing 
     Various ability-enhancing clothing 
     Over 120 backstories 

    Rabbie race mod allows you to customize your pawn by combining different pretty outfits and colors.
    Give your pawns a unique personality by mixing different face, ear shapes and hairstyles.
    All Rabbie apparel also fit perfectly with vanilla outfits, with proper in-game balancing.

    Rabbie race mod seeks to enrich the enjoyment of vanilla play.
    Rabbie's equipment is expensive and requires a long time to craft, and you will still need vanilla weapons and equipment to survive.
    Also, other clothing and equipment mods can be used naturally.

    A race mod for bloodthirsty foxgirls in RimWorld.
    
    Revia are near-humans with vulpine traits. Feared in the sector of the galaxy that they exist in for their warlike natures, it is said that Revia accept only one absolute law in their society: the strong live and prosper, and the weak serve the strong in whatever way they are able.
    Their society worships bloodshed in the name of a certain deity that sits upon a throne of bleached skulls, and will stop at nothing to slake his thirst.
    
    Features:
    - A foxgirl race with guaranteed Bloodlust trait.
    - A mechanic which allows them to grow extra tails as they offer more sacrifices to their blood god. They become stronger in melee, take less damage, and have more hitpoints as they gain more tails. Caps out at 9.
    - A faction of their kind which acts hostile, and whose raiders will never retreat. Blood is blood, no matter whose side spills it!
    - Some weapons that fit with their bloodthirsty nature. Their weapons have lower armor penetration than standard ones, however they inflict significantly greater bleed damage.
    - No racial clothes limitations! No hair limitations! These foxgirls are very much humanlike. Pick and choose your favourite cosmetic mods and roll with it!
    
    Suggested mods to go with this one:
    - Some form of hat-hiding mod. Hats for humans clash badly with fox ears.
    - A Rimworld of Magic

These act like drop pods, but are not one use -- when you bring it back home you choose where to land and disembark.

Great for hauling cargo, trading with factions, assaulting points of interest on your world map, and so much more. Acts as both a caravan and a drop pod.

A few additional role-specific short range transport shuttles (or SRTS) so you really can fly across the whole world and back again. All ships require their own research project, and they're not cheap. All passengers heal, rest, and eat while on board all transport shuttles, but some shuttles are easier than others to rest in.

Conflicts
- Multiplayer mod: You will not be able to actually load anything into the ship. It won't work. Sorry.

Well helicopters are here to bring you just that, helicopters have always been the king when it comes to aeronautical utility, the ability for helicopters to land without a runway is incredibly useful, especially when secure spaces are of a premium due to pesky raiders trying to steal your tables, it also allows you to launch attack operations without needing an entire airfield to land on, which is great for retaliation and retaking your stolen tables.
